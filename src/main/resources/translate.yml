#Simply translate the text here into whatever language you want.
#Whatever you put here is what will appear in game. Do not modify
#the YAML headers, as this will break things. Can't see the YAML
#formatting properly? I use Notepad++ to edit YAML. Google it.

#If this file breaks for some reason, backup your translations,
#and delete this file. A new one with the original English will
#generate the next time you start or reload your server.

#If you wish to submit your translation file and have it be
#officially supported by HorseStats, send me a PM on BukkitDev
#and I'll check it out.

#The text in this file is sorted by the classes the strings
#belong in. This is mainly to help me with development, but
#should make your life easier too.

#HorseStats uses the raw "true" and "false" objects returned
#by horse statistics, and thus these cannot be translated.
